# Component Based UI

- RESTy Phase 1: Begin work on the RESTy API testing application
- RESTy Phase 2: Retrieving User Input and Managing State

### Phase 1 Requirements
- Today, we begin the first of a 4-Phase build of the RESTy application, written in React. In this first phase, our goal is to setup the basic scaffolding of the application, with intent being to add more functionality to the system as we go. This initial build sets up the file structure so that we can progressively build this application in a scalable manner. 

### Phase 2 Requirements
- In phase 2, we will be receiving user input in preparation of connecting to live APIs, using the useState() hook in our functional components

- The following user stories detail the major functionality for this phase of the project.

- As a user, I want to enter the REST Method and URL to an API
- As a user, I want to see a summary of my request as well as results returned from an API request in my browser in a readable format

### Phase 3 Requirements
- In phase 3, we will be connecting RESTy to live APIs, fetching and displaying remote data. Our primary focus will be to service GET requests

- The following user stories detail the major functionality for this phase of the project.

- As a user, I want to enter the URL to an API and issue a GET request so that I can retrieve it’s data
- As a user, I want to see the results returned from an API request in my browser in a readable format
Application Flow:

- User enters an API URL
- Chooses a REST Method
- Clicks the “Go” button
- Application fetches data from the URL given, with the method specified
- Displays the response headers and results separately
- Both headers and results should be “pretty printed” JSON

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
